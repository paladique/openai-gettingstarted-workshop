# Getting Started with OpenAI API

This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks adapted from the [Azure OpenAI Samples Repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openai-samples) that include notebooks that access [OpenAI](notebooks-oai) and [Azure OpenAI](notebooks-azure-oai) services.

The Python OpenAI API works with Azure OpenAI Models as well, with a few modifications. Learn more about the differences here: [How to switch between OpenAI and Azure OpenAI endpoints with Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/switching-endpoints?WT_mc_id=academic-109527-jasmineg)
